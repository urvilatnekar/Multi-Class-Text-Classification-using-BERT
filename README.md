# Multi-Class-Text-Classification-using-BERT
Recent years have seen an exponential increase of textual data, making accurate and effective classification models essential. In this project, we explore the area of deep learning-based multi-class text categorization, utilizing BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in particular. BERT, a ground-breaking language model that Google introduced, has displayed outstanding performance in a variety of NLP applications, including text classification. BERT is a prime contender for multi-class classification issues because it can effectively capture the complex semantic linkages seen in textual data by utilizing its pre-trained contextual word representations. Through a step-by-step implementation using well-known deep learning frameworks, we study the fundamentals of leveraging BERT for multi-class text classification in this project. The ag_news dataset is a collection of news articles from the AG's corpus, which is a collection of news articles gathered from various sources. The dataset is labeled with four categories: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. Each news article is associated with one of these categories, making it suitable for multi-class text classification tasks.

#### TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):

TF-IDF is a widely used technique for text representation.
It assigns weights to words based on their frequency in a document and across the entire corpus.
TF-IDF considers both the term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) to highlight important words.
It is a simple and interpretable approach but may struggle with capturing contextual information and complex semantic relationships.

#### Word Embeddings:

Word embeddings, such as Word2Vec and GloVe, were introduced to address the limitations of TF-IDF.
Word embeddings represent words as dense vectors in a continuous space.
These vectors capture semantic relationships and can be used as input features for various machine learning models.
Word2Vec and GloVe models are trained on large text corpora to learn distributed representations of words.

#### Contextual Word Embeddings:

Contextual word embeddings aim to capture the context and meaning of words within a sentence or document.
Models like ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) introduced contextual word embeddings.
These models leverage deep learning architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformer models, to generate word representations that consider the surrounding context.
Contextual word embeddings offer improved performance in tasks requiring understanding of word sense disambiguation and semantic relationships.

#### RNNs and LSTM:

Before the emergence of transformer models, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were commonly used for sequential data processing tasks, including NLP.
RNNs process sequences by maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous steps.
However, traditional RNNs often face challenges in capturing long-term dependencies due to the vanishing gradient problem.
LSTM was introduced as an improvement over traditional RNNs to address the issue of capturing long-range dependencies.
LSTM incorporates memory cells and gating mechanisms that allow the model to selectively retain and update information over long sequences.
LSTM has been widely used in tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation.

#### Bi-LSTM:

Bi-LSTM extends the capabilities of LSTM by incorporating bidirectionality.
In addition to considering the past context (previous words in a sequence), Bi-LSTM also considers the future context (subsequent words).
By processing the input sequence in both forward and backward directions, Bi-LSTM captures information from both past and future contexts.
Bi-LSTM has been successful in tasks where understanding the full context is crucial, such as sentiment analysis, question-answering, and part-of-speech tagging.
Bi-LSTM models have been widely used before the advent of transformer-based models like BERT.

#### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):

BERT is a transformer-based model introduced by Google in 2018.
BERT takes the contextual word embedding approach to the next level by considering bidirectional context.
It pre-trains a deep bidirectional transformer model on a large corpus, capturing rich context from both preceding and succeeding words.
BERT can be fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question-answering.
Fine-tuning BERT on task-specific data enables it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks.

#### Transformer-based Models:

BERT's success paved the way for various transformer-based models in NLP.
Models like GPT-2, GPT-3, and Transformer-XL introduced advancements in language generation, language understanding, and handling long-range dependencies.
These models often require substantial computational resources for training and inference but offer remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation.
